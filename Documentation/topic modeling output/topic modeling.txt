This is what I got by looking for bigrams in each week. Here are top 30 for each week.
# code below.
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_df=0.9, min_df=1, ngram_range=(2, 2)) # checking bigrams

# TF-IDF score meaning:
# The value next to each phrase (e.g., "pay period (0.0043)") is its TF-IDF score.
# This score reflects how important the phrase is in that week's documents:
# - High TF (term frequency): the phrase appears often in that week.
# - Low DF (document frequency): the phrase appears rarely in other weeks.
# â†’ So, higher scores = more specific to that week's discussion.
